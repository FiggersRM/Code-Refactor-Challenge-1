# Code-Refactor-Challenge-1

## Description

With this challenge, we took an html file with a CSS stylesheet and refactored the code. This included adding semantic elements to the webpage as well as tidying up the CSS sheet. It required creating a repository and staging, commiting, and pushing the code to that repository. Alternative descriptions were also added to the images on the website for increased accessibility. Comments were also added to both the html file as well as the CSS sheet to describe changes that had been made and refactored. We also created a deployed application through Github. Below is a link to the deployed application as well as an image of the deployed website.
